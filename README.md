# Mickle â€” The Next-Gen Communication Platform

Welcome to the Mickle project, an innovative communication application designed to be a superior alternative to Discord, Guilded, and TeamSpeak 5. Talk aims to address the shortcomings of these platforms by offering a comprehensive, low-resource, and self-hosted communication solution that encompasses advanced features for voice and video calls, chat, and group management.

Actually, this project is maintained by Czech people and it's not a commercial project. We are developing this project for fun and to learn new things. A lot of resources are written in Czech language, but we are trying to translate them to English.

We plan to monetize the project by offering premium features, such as server hosting, premium support, security, and other services. However, the ALL functionality of Mickle will always be free and open-source for everyone to use.

## Why Mickle?
